Adds a custom shortcode that returns the number of children for a given page. Accepts page ID, name, or slug as input.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to dynamically return the number of children for a particular page. Inserting `[children page="page-slug"]` in a post or page, or `<?php do_shortcode('children page="page-slug" '); ?>` anywhere in WordPress' code will return the number of children for that particular page.

Useful for creating dynamic table of contents pages, keeping track of page stats, general bragging, or any place where keeping a running tally might be desirable. 

== Installation ==
1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `count-children` directory.
2. Upload this directory inside your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate 'Count Children' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Insert `[children page="page-slug"]` in a post or page (replacing page-slug with an acutal slug name) to return the number of child pages under that page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I add it into my posts? =
You must insert the shortcode in location where you want to count to appear: (always replacing page-slug with an acutal slug name)

* `[children page="page-slug"]`

The shortcode assumes you are giving it slugs, but it can also accept page names or IDs:

* `[children type="name" page="Parent Page Name"]`
* `[children type="id" page="28"]`

= It keeps returning 0 pages, why? =
Make sure you're using the correct page slug, sometimes they are different from the actual page name and capitalization matters. You can view them by clicking on the All Pages link under Pages. 

Also don't literally copy "page-slug," you need to put the parent page you want counted there, that's just a place holder. So to count the number of children in a page called 'Book Reviews' with a slug name of 'book-reviews' you would insert `[children page="book-reviews"]`. 

= Are there other shortcodes? =
[children] is the primary one, but there is also [countchildren], [childcount], and [pagechildren].

= Can I change the shortcode? =
Yes, just open `count-children.php` and add or change what text you want to trigger the shortcode in the array near the bottom.

= Can you add this feature I just thought of? =
Can I? Yes. Will I? Yes, if I think it would be a helpful addition. I'm trying to keep things clean and simple, but there's always room for improvement, so let me know if you think a feature is lacking!
